Backlight Dimming

LCD driven by GPIO using custom RGB 565 overlay

Made for Pi Zero and Zero W, works perfectly with Pi 3

**Installation Instructions**

Download repository, extract it, choose the folder that corresponds to the LCD you're using, and copy all files and subfolders to the BOOT partition of a Raspbian/RetroPie image. You must overwrite the original config.txt, and you must merge the overlay folder.

Install the SD card and boot up. That's all.

Backlight will be set to 100% at bootup. Software will be added soon to allow backlight dimming.

**The following LCDs are compatible with the Topper (more to come as I test them):**
