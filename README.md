# Raspberry Pi DPI Topper

Backlight Dimming

LCD driven by GPIO using custom RGB 565 overlay

Made for Pi Zero and Zero W, works perfectly with Pi 3

**Installation Instructions**

Download repository, extract and copy all subfolders to the BOOT partition of a Raspbian/RetroPie image. You must overwrite the original config.txt

Install the SD card and boot up. That's all.

Backlight will be set to 100% at bootup. Software will be added soon to allow backlight dimming.
